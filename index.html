                                    <p>Inspired by Buteyko principles, this exercise uses gentle, light nasal breathing with brief, comfortable pauses after exhaling. It aims to normalize breathing patterns and gently increase CO2 tolerance, promoting calm and nervous system balance. Always breathe softly in and out through your nose. Consistency is key; practice for 5 minutes, 2-3 times daily, focusing on ease, to potentially improve respiratory comfort.</p>
